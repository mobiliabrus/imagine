Never re-create dream from your memory, cause building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.

Vision

No one was born to run. My parents bought me this. I was a oriental boy when I went to College in 3202.

My parents were employees. Most of money they earned recharge in the college software.
I learnt running which is the most important skill people need to have here.

I had a crush on a girl that her skin is white and and shiny.
She was learning scuba diving course which others won't chose.
I believe it's the most angelic career that she could show the beautiful underwater world to the crowd with limited activity.
